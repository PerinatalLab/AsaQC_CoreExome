## General Info

In this round of QC, statistics on **142 individuals** were analyzed.



The following plots present the filtering criteria and results for 3 filters - proportion of SNPs missing in each individual (IMISS), proportion of heterozygous loci in each individual (HET) and SNPs with Mendelian errors per individual (MERR).

## Final statistics of pre-QC filtering
Starting number of individuals: 142  
Number of individuals passed all filters: 141  
Individuals flagged by IMISS filter: 0  
Individuals flagged by HET filter: 1  
Individuals flagged by MERR filter: 1  

The following Venn diagram shows whether the same individuals fail more than one filter:

## Writing final output
Final output will now be written to directory /home/julius/Desktop/2015MAR/torin_new_plink/150609_87fb294/QC_ind_2/. Files *full-stats* contain full filtering statistics, files *selected* contain the lists for automatic selection of individuals and SNPs to keep.
